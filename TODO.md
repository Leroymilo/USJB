# List of what could be added to this mod and how to do it

The order can be considered as priority.
The extension .xcf is for GIMP files, the image editing software I am using.

## Obelisks

The goal is to complete the set of Zen-Garden Obelisks. Check [here](https://github.com/Leroymilo/USJB/tree/main/assets/Buildings/Obelisks) for a reference on how the obelisks are made, here's an explanation on how the pieces are made into the obelisks in game :
- chosing the base (normal or winter) depending on the season
- adding pieces of borders depending on the user's settings
- adding the feature depending on the season

To add a new Obelisk, the mod would need 2 textures :
- a seasonal feature (it is recommended to use the same flower petals for spring and fallen leaves for fall as the other textures to make the set coherent). It has to fit in a 46x46 square, but there's a 3 pixels tall line at the bottom that will be covered by the border, and I recommend it to make it smaller anyway so the sand base texture fits in the 48x48 texture.
- a base with sand lines going around the feature, it has to be based on [this](https://github.com/Leroymilo/USJB/blob/main/images/obelisk_base.png) so that the sand lines and color match with other obelisks. It is not necessary to make the winter variant, I can do it myself with GIMP.

See [this](https://github.com/Leroymilo/USJB/blob/main/images/Obelisks%20Showcase.gif) for an example.

### Island Obelisk

There have been multiple ideas for the Island Obelisk :
- a pond with a small bridge ([prototype](https://github.com/Leroymilo/USJB/blob/main/images/obelisk_bridge_prototype.png) by myself).
- a pond with a small island in it.
- a single rock shaped and colored like the island (because rocks are supposed to represent island in Japanese zen-gardens)

### Desert Obelisk

This one does not need to be worked on, but when I reworked the Obelisks I had to re-draw the base myself and I'm not fully happy with the result, so it would be nice if an artist re-drew it again.

### Earth and Water Obelisks

It has been pointed out that they are not very recognizable as actual mountain and beach obelisks, so any redesign idea is welcome as well. This also stands for the Desert Obelisk.

### Other Obelisks

This is very low priority. I am currently working on another mod (a lot of coding I have to do before adding new sprites) that would introduce a set of Zen-Garden pieces as Furniture. The mod would make it so that Zen-Gardens placed next to each-other would update their borders to connect. Here are a few ideas in addition to the designs used for obelisks in this mod :
- cairn (a pile of polished rocks)
- pond
- sand spiral (no feature)
- vertical sand lines
- corner sand lines
- tori

## Craftables

Not much to say about them, check this [sprite-sheet](https://github.com/Leroymilo/USJB/blob/main/assets/Craftables.png) to see which ones are in need of a re-sprite. It is mostly about machines and common decorations, no need to reskin everything. No requirements except 16x32 sprites.

## Junimo House

The open door sprites of the [Stone Junimo House](https://github.com/Leroymilo/USJB/blob/main/assets/Buildings/junimo_hut_stone.png) does not really match their textures.

## Shipping Bin, Cat Bowls & Dog Houses

Suggested on the mod page.

## New Cabins

1.6 added multiple new cabins that are not modified by the mod.

## Gold Clock

There's already a [Gold Clock reskin](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9670) available on Nexus, but I got no answer from the author if I could add their art in this mod, so a new sprite would not be necessary if someone can contact them.

## Fish Pond

It would be nice to adapt the fish pond accessories to a Japanese style, but it's not too much at odds with the rest of the sprites to be honest, so it's low priority.

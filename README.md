Go [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/9704) for credits, builds and general info about this mod.

Credits: All sprites ar from [the original Seasonal Japanese Textures from SonreirAngel](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3947) (outdated) unless specified.  
I (Leroymilo) did some slight changes to a lot of sprites, often to match the vanilla building shadow, or better match the collisions. I also made PaintMasks for everything, unless specified.  
The AT version (only contains Furniture and Craftables) was mostly done by [marrojo2000](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R8vsw5pDBTc9I4EMeLMVcs5i7hSEigVh?usp=sharing) and cleaned up by me.
